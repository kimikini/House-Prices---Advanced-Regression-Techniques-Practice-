# House-Prices---Advanced-Regression-Techniques-Practice-
**üè° House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques-Kaggle-Competition-Project**<br>
This repository contains my analysis and machine learning models developed for the House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques competition on Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data<br>

**üéØ Objective**<br>
The goal of this project is to build predictive models that estimate house prices based on provided features, such as lot size, neighborhood, house style, and more. <br>

**üèÜ Best Score**<br>
My highest score on the Kaggle leaderboard so far is 0.15652.<br>

**Description**<br>
The data sets:<br>
One train data set: 1460 rows (missing value exist)<br>
One test data set: 1459 rows  (missing value exist)<br>

**Key Variables (79 variables in train data set)**<br>
SalePrice: The property's sale price in dollars (target variable)<br>
MSSubClass: The building class<br>
MSZoning: The general zoning classification<br>
LotFrontage: Linear feet of street connected to property<br>
LotArea: Lot size in square feet<br>
Street, Alley, LotShape, LandContour, Utilities, LotConfig, LandSlope, and many more...<br>
